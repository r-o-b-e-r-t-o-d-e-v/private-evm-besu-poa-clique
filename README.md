# Private EVM | Hyperledger Besu | PoA (Clique)

---

## Overview

This project is aimed to launch a private EVM based blockchain by deploying
a few nodes using Docker technology.

The client nodes are handled by using Hyperledger Besu that runs a PoA
consensus protocol implemented with Clique.

There are several examples in this project. They are a showcase on the
different possibilities that we have to deploy nodes. 

---

### Single node example

The `/single-node` folder holds an example that allows to run a single Besu
node.

More details can be found [here](single-node/README.md)

---

### Multiple nodes: Node discovery example

The `/node-discovery` folder is an example that shows how to orchestrate
several Besu nodes with automatic node discovery.

More details can be found [here](multiple-nodes/node-discovery/README.md)

###  Multiple nodes: Static nodes example

_WIP..._
